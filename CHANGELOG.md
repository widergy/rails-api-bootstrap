# Rails Api Bootstrap Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order.

**Rails Api Bootstrap follows a modified version of [SemVer](http://semver.org)**. For a `X.Y.Z` release:

* `Z` (PATCH) indicates bug fixes only; no breaking changes and no new features, except as necessary for security fixes.
* `Y` (MINOR) is bumped when we add new features. Occasionally a `Y` release may include small breaking changes. Those will be notified via CHANGELOG entries and/or deprecation notices if there are breaking changes.
* `X` (MAJOR) is incremented for significant breaking changes. This is reserved for special occasions, like when an API version is deprecated.
